Part A

The difference in execution times between the DataFrame API and the SQL API in Spark can be attributed to several factors. While both approaches eventually compile to the same underlying Spark execution plan, there are subtle differences that can impact performance. Here's why the DataFrame API might be faster in your case:

### Reasons for the Performance Difference

1. **Optimization Pipeline**:
   - The DataFrame API integrates seamlessly with Spark's Catalyst optimizer, which directly optimizes the operations as they're expressed in code.
   - With SQL queries, Spark must first parse the SQL string into a logical plan and then optimize it. This parsing step introduces additional overhead, particularly for complex queries.

2. **Execution Overhead**:
   - SQL queries require an additional step to convert the SQL string into a logical plan, which can add overhead.
   - DataFrame operations are already expressed as a structured API, so they skip this intermediate parsing phase.

3. **Serialization and Communication**:
   - If you're using temporary views with the SQL API, there might be minor overhead in creating and managing these views, especially in distributed environments.
   - DataFrames operate directly on the distributed data without needing such intermediate steps.

4. **Type Safety**:
   - The DataFrame API uses Python/Scala/Java functions directly, which are type-safe and integrated into the codebase.
   - SQL strings are less integrated and might introduce inefficiencies in type inference and validation.

5. **Optimization Specifics**:
   - When using the DataFrame API, you're directly calling optimized functions (like `filter`, `groupBy`, etc.), which might lead to more efficient execution plans.
   - In SQL, Spark has to infer how to optimize the query, which can sometimes be less efficient than explicitly calling API functions.

6. **Execution Plan Differences**:
   - Even though both methods ultimately generate a physical execution plan, there might be subtle differences in how certain operations (like window functions or groupings) are executed, depending on how they are expressed.

### When SQL Can Be Faster
In some cases, SQL can outperform the DataFrame API:
- **Complex Joins**: SQL queries can sometimes produce more optimized join strategies when using advanced SQL constructs.
- **Declarative Nature**: For certain operations, SQL's declarative style might allow Spark to infer optimizations more effectively.

Part B

The difference in execution time between Parquet and CSV is due to the inherent differences in how these file formats are structured and handled by Spark:

### **Why Parquet is Faster than CSV**

1. **Binary Format and Compression**:
   - **Parquet** is a binary, columnar storage format optimized for analytical workloads. It stores data in a compressed and efficient manner, which reduces I/O operations when reading and writing.
   - **CSV** is a plain text format. It is not compressed, and parsing text requires more processing power, increasing the overhead.

2. **Schema Information**:
   - **Parquet** files store schema information as metadata. This allows Spark to directly infer column types without scanning the file, saving time.
   - **CSV** files lack schema information, so Spark must infer the schema (if not provided), which involves scanning a portion of the file.

3. **Columnar Storage**:
   - **Parquet** organizes data by columns, which is efficient for analytical queries that often operate on a subset of columns.
   - **CSV** stores data row-by-row, requiring the entire row to be read even if only a few columns are needed.

4. **Serialization and Deserialization**:
   - Reading **Parquet** involves lightweight deserialization compared to parsing **CSV**, which is text-heavy and more prone to inconsistencies (e.g., handling delimiters, quotes, and escaping characters).

5. **Optimized for Spark**:
   - **Parquet** integrates well with Spark's Catalyst optimizer, making it highly efficient for distributed queries.
   - **CSV** processing does not benefit from such optimizations and tends to be slower for larger datasets.

### **Practical Considerations**
- **I/O Costs**: 
   - Reading a **CSV** involves more data transfer since it's uncompressed, while **Parquet** requires transferring less data.
- **Data Size**:
   - **Parquet** files are typically smaller in size due to compression, further reducing read times.

### **Conclusion**
The faster read time for **Parquet** demonstrates its efficiency for analytical workflows. For large-scale processing, using columnar formats like Parquet or ORC is highly recommended over row-based formats like CSV.
