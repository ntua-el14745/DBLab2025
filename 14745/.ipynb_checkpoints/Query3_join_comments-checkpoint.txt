To evaluate the performance of the joins and decide the best-suited one, here’s a consolidated analysis of the **Shuffle Hash Join**, **Broadcast Hash Join**, and **Shuffle Replicate Nested Loop Join** from the physical plans you provided:

---

### **1. Shuffle Hash Join**:
- **Description**: 
  - The **Shuffle Hash Join** partitions the data on both sides of the join condition (`COMM`) and distributes it across the cluster. Each partition processes the join locally.
  - It is typically used when both datasets are large but can still fit into memory after partitioning.

- **Advantages**:
  - Scales well for large datasets.
  - Ensures distributed parallelism for performance.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Shuffle operations are expensive in terms of network I/O.
  - Performance can degrade significantly if the data skew exists (i.e., when certain `COMM` values have significantly more rows than others).

- **Best Suited**: 
  - When both datasets are large and can be efficiently partitioned on the join key.
  - Works well for **equi-joins**.

---

### **2. Broadcast Hash Join**:
- **Description**: 
  - The **Broadcast Hash Join** replicates the smaller dataset across all worker nodes. The larger dataset is then scanned, and join conditions are evaluated using the replicated smaller dataset.

- **Advantages**:
  - Extremely fast for joins where one dataset is small enough to fit in memory.
  - Avoids the shuffle cost for the smaller dataset.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Memory-intensive, as the smaller dataset must be broadcast to all nodes.
  - Not suitable if the smaller dataset cannot fit into memory.

- **Best Suited**: 
  - When one dataset is much smaller than the other (e.g., a lookup table or filtered spatial data).
  - Effective for **equi-joins** when broadcast conditions are met.

---

### **3. Shuffle Replicate Nested Loop Join (NL Join)**:
- **Description**: 
  - The **Shuffle Replicate NL Join** replicates one dataset across all partitions of the other and evaluates the join condition for all record pairs. It is typically used for **non-equi joins** or spatial joins involving complex predicates (e.g., `WITHIN`).

- **Advantages**:
  - Handles complex, non-equi join conditions like spatial predicates efficiently.
  - Can process joins when no other join types are applicable.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Extremely expensive due to the Cartesian product nature of nested loops.
  - Requires significant memory and processing power, especially for large datasets.

- **Best Suited**:
  - When the join condition involves non-equi predicates (e.g., spatial predicates like `WITHIN` or `OVERLAPS`).
  - For datasets where one side can be replicated without memory issues.

### **Consolidated Comparison**:
| Join Type                   | Best for                   | Limitations                            | Cost Efficiency |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Shuffle Hash Join**       | Large datasets, equi-joins | Expensive shuffle, sensitive to skew  | Moderate        |
| **Broadcast Hash Join**     | One small, one large set   | Memory constraints, large broadcasts   | High (if feasible) |
| **Shuffle Replicate NL Join** | Non-equi or spatial joins | Extremely costly for large datasets    | Low (except spatial) |

---

### **Which is the Best?**
1. **For Equi-Joins**:
   - If both datasets are large: **Shuffle Hash Join**.
   - If one dataset is small: **Broadcast Hash Join**.

2. **For Spatial Joins** (non-equi predicates like `WITHIN`):
   - **Shuffle Replicate NL Join** is necessary but should be optimized by:
     - Ensuring the replicated dataset is as small as possible.
     - Using spatial indexes or specialized libraries (e.g., Sedona) to reduce computation costs.

Given the dataset sizes

1. **Income Dataset**: ~13KB (very small).
2. **Census Dataset**: ~184MB (moderately large).
3. **Crime Dataset**: ~500MB (large, split into two parts).

Here’s how this impacts the choice of join strategies for the different datasets:

### **Analysis of Joins**

#### **1. Broadcast Hash Join**:
- **Best Scenario**:
  - **Broadcast the Income Dataset** (~13KB) as it is very small and fits easily in memory.
  - This avoids shuffling the larger Census or Crime datasets.
- **Usage**:
  - Use Broadcast Hash Join for the join between the **Income** dataset and the **Census** dataset.
  - Suitable for the equi-join on `COMM` or similar simple keys.

#### **2. Shuffle Hash Join**:
- **Best Scenario**:
  - When joining **Census** (~184MB) with **Crime** (~500MB).
  - These datasets are too large to broadcast, so shuffling and partitioning on the join key (`COMM`) ensures distributed computation.
- **Usage**:
  - Apply for joins between the larger datasets (Census and Crime) where an equi-join is possible.

#### **3. Shuffle Replicate NL Join**:
- **Best Scenario**:
  - Necessary for spatial joins like the **WITHIN** operation between **Census** and **Crime** datasets.
  - Since spatial joins typically involve non-equi conditions, NL Join is required.
- **Optimizations**:
  - Reduce the dataset size before the join:
    - Use spatial filtering or pre-aggregation to limit the number of rows in the Census or Crime datasets.
    - Partition the Crime data intelligently to minimize replication overhead.

### **Suggested Join Strategy**

1. **Income Join (Income + Census)**:
   - Use a **Broadcast Hash Join**.
   - Broadcast the Income dataset (13KB) and join with the Census dataset (184MB).
   - This ensures minimal shuffle and high performance.

2. **Census and Crime Data Join**:
   - If it's a **spatial join** (e.g., `WITHIN`), use **Shuffle Replicate NL Join**:
     - Optimize by pre-aggregating or filtering both datasets to reduce their sizes.
     - Use libraries like **Sedona** for spatial indexing and faster computation.
   - If it's an **equi-join** on `COMM` or similar, use **Shuffle Hash Join**:
     - Partition both datasets on the join key to avoid excessive shuffling.

3. **Final Join (All Data Combined)**:
   - Perform the joins in stages, starting with smaller datasets (Income + Census), then join the resulting dataset with the larger Crime dataset.
   - This hierarchical join approach minimizes intermediate data size and computational overhead.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Primary Strategy**: Use **Broadcast Hash Join** wherever possible (Income + Census), as the Income dataset is very small.
- **Fallback Strategy**: Use **Shuffle Hash Join** for larger datasets (Census + Crime).
- **Spatial Joins**: For spatial operations (`WITHIN`), optimize the **Shuffle Replicate NL Join** by reducing data size or using spatial indexes.
